# Typing-Speed-Analyzer
FingerSprint is a terminal-based typing speed test game that measures your typing speed (WPM) and accuracy. Test your typing skills and see how fast and accurately you can type in one minute.

I have used the Curses library in this project, which is a terminal handling library for creating text user interfaces. Additionally, I have used the JSON module for storing and loading data, specifically for storing users' high scores.
